        "One of the most important actions in life is preparing, whether it be preparing for a test by studying or gathering the right ingredients to make a meal, preparation is a key step towards success. Just like everyone, data isn't perfect, can have mistakes, and often leaves the toilet seat up. Maybe not the latter, but the process of data collection yields much room for error whether it be missing data values or inaccurate data readings. While the best thing to do before storing your data should be validating it, this hasn't been the case for many real world data sets. For this reason, we should clean our data before diving into analysis. \n",
