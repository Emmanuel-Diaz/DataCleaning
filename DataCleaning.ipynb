Just like everyone, data isn't perfect, can have mistakes, and often forgets to text back(FUNNY). Maybe not the latter, but the process of data collection yields much room for error whether it be missing data values or inaccurate data readings. For this reason, we should prepare our data before diving into analysis. \n",
